This GitHub Actions plugin is supposed to be used together with [judges-action]
  (the documentation is over there).
This plugin takes a [factbase] file generated by the [judges-action] and prints
  its content in YAML, XML, and HTML formats.
Also, it prints a user-friendly HTML document with a summary of project status
  (we call it "vitals" page).
This is how this vitals page looks for [our team][vitals].

The following configuration options are supported here:

```yaml
- uses: zerocracy/pages-action@0.6.2
  with:
    factbase: foo.fb
    verbose: true
    output: my-directory
    columns: who,when,repository
    hidden: _id,_time
```

The following options are supported:

* `factbase` (optional) is the name of the [factbase] file. If not provided,
the action will automatically look for a single `.fb` file in the current directory;
* `options` (empty by default) is a list of `k=v` options to be sent to
the [judges] command line tool;
* `output` (default: `pages`) is the directory where .XML, .YAML,
and .HTML files are supposed to be saved to;
* `logo` (optional) is the URL of the logo to put on the vitals HTML page;
* `columns` (optional) is a comma-separated list of columns
to print in the HTML;
* `hidden` (optional) is a comma-separated list of columns to hide;
* `today` (optional) is ISO-8601 date-time of today;
* `verbose` (default: `false`) turns on a more detailed logging.
* `adless` (default: `false`) hides all Zerocracy banners, links, and logos
* `github-token` (optional) is the GitHub token, defaulted to repo-scoped token

More details are in the [`action.yml`][action] file.
